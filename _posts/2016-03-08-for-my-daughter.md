![my daughter]({{ site.baseurl }}graphics/Norah-book.jpg)

I was born a man, and I am still a man---and a *straight white* man at that. This puts me in a pretty advantageous position. I get the benefit of the doubt from police officers, business owners, government officials, and especially other straight white men. I get paid more than others do. I meet very little resistance in life, and very few societal hands try to coerce me into being something in particular. Throughout my life, I have made it a point never to forget that---especially as *many* other straight white men around me do just that. I have also done my best to make sure that others don’t forget that the power structure of whiteness and maleness still exists, and to realize the benefits and burdens involved. 

Now that I have a daughter, I feel the urgency of my mission all the more strongly. I have a duty to this beautiful little girl to make sure that she grows up to be a strong, compassionate woman---and nothing more. What I mean by that “nothing more” clause is that I see my mission as being to ensure that I’m not just another man trying to mold my daughter into something. My mission is to give her what she needs to make herself into exactly who she wants to be, and love that person with all my heart.

I am a man, and I’ve spent time around plenty of men in my life. I know that my daughter will encounter many of them in the world and they will expect her to be various things. As a father, I want to spend all the time that I can with her so that she comes to understand that none of those expectations means a damn thing, and that she has the power to determine the kind of woman she will be. 

My daughter is not even 2 years old yet. So I have a long road ahead of me. I know that this will be hard work. I know that there will be challenges, tears, and hurt feelings along the way---I would expect nothing less. However, it will all be worth it when my fully grown daughter looks at me, and I can see in her eyes that she is fulfilled---that she is who she wants to be---not who some man or group of men (not even me) wants her to be. I will protect her, nurture her, and comfort her, but all in the service of making her into her own person, not because I view her as fragile or dependent. I already know she is strong; she has inherited [her mother’s](http://freelancingmama.com/) strength. I need only ensure that that strength serves her well, and that whatever she chooses, she choose it because it is what she wants---knowing that I will be proud of her in turn.
