From the time I was a toddler until I broke away from the Catholic church in high school, I attended mass every Sunday. I would watch as hundreds of people of all ages filed in each week, and filled the pews. I found myself fascinated and comforted by one aspect of the proceedings in particular---the pre-communion ritual.

For those uninitiated, it is the epitome of ceremony. The priest, clad in robes and embroidered regalia, receives water and wine in ornate glass decanters, from the altar boys (or girls, as is now the case). He then proceeds with an oration, a blessing, written and codified so as to replicate the solemn blessings of Jesus at the historical last supper. The words themselves will vary slightly from priest to priest, but regular attendees tend to learn them by heart. Interlaced with these ancient words are these graceful and elaborate, yet understated gestures---signs of the cross over the chalice and the wafer, raising the wafer above the priest’s head and bowing, kneeling, etc. The whole series is only a few minutes long, but is utterly saturated with an air of ritual. And that brings me to the real focus of this piece of writing: ritual.

## Ritual: the Gateway to Habit

In all of the productivity literature I’ve read, there are numerous hacks and tricks invoked---all promising to deliver huge and immediate gains in productivity. The problem, though, is that none of those tricks or hacks will deliver the most important thing---sustained productivity gains. Only habit will do this. A fancy trick, or flashy new tool will make you feel great about yourself and your process for a while---until you fall back into your old habits. This is true in any realm of one’s life, from relationships to work, and beyond.

What really reaps benefits, what really cements progress, is the solidification of habits. Those who have good habits, by and large, do well. Those who have bad habits, for the most part, do not do well. I think that often times, we get distracted from that simple truth by the (extremely) short-term peaks that we see when we begin using a new app to track our tasks, or get a new notebook with a cool new pen. Those peaks fade at the exact same rate as the excitement about the new tools and methods do. We then find ourselves back in the old habits that we find comfortable.

I want to be clear here about the term “comfort”. Comfort does not mean satisfaction, contentment, or happiness. All it really means is whatever one is used to. Heroin addicts are used to either pain and sickness or euphoria, and no middle-ground. Abused children are used to violence and trauma. The list goes on and on. The point is, people are extraordinarily adaptable beings, and they do adapt to being comfortable with terrible and damaging situations.
Here’s the formula:

 - People crave comfort
 - Comfort comes from familiarity---from being able to predict what is going to happen, and watching it unfold as predicted.
 - Ritual makes this familiarity concrete. It literally lays out how to make sure everyone knows what’s going to happen, exactly when, and exactly how.


It stands to reason, then, that rituals are the secret to progress. If you are unhappy, chances are the following things are true: there are already rituals in place, but they are bad ones. You’ll need to slowly cut and paste within the existing rituals of your life to transform them into good ones. Swap out the unsavory activities for ones that help make advancements toward your goals. There is no easy way to do this, but the focus is much smaller than on just “making changes”.

The real “trick”, if there is one, is to really grab on to the ritual. In order to do that, you have to insert something that you look forward to---usually something sensory. For instance, for the last 3 years or so, I realized that if I wanted to stay physically fit---given the other goings on in my life---I’d have to work out early in the morning. The necessary wake-up time is about 4 am. At first this was completely paralyzing to think about, but waking up at that time became easier if it allowed me time to listen to the radio and make myself a cup of coffee, as well as fiddle around on the computer. These things are not the primary activity---working out is. However, they are part of the ritual---a part that provides immediate gratification to that version of me that was weakest as I began building the ritual. Now, 3 years in, if I don’t wake up at 4 am on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, something feels off. I begin to feel uncomfortable.


## Strive for Comfort

To put a bow on what I’ve laid out above, I’m going to offer a very unconventional maxim. At least, it’s unconventional for this space---the space where people claiming to be productivity gurus foist their commandments upon the masses in so many worn-out aphorisms. So here’s my unconventional advice: leverage comfort to your advantage.

I’m constantly hearing attempts at motivation that tell us to push outside of our comfort zone. To an extent, this is good advice, but it is only part of the story. If you are constantly outside of your comfort zone, you will wear yourself out, because human beings crave comfort. Rather, strive for a new comfortable---a new normal---but do so in steps. This is the cut and paste method I mentioned above; take an already comfortable ritual in your repertoire, and cut out a small part, replacing it with something that makes a healthier ritual. After a short time, do the same with another small aspect of the ritual, until the ritual becomes a healthy one---meaning that it is working toward a goal of yours.

This may be a piece of advice already out there; I’m not claiming that I scoured the entire internet looking for something like it. I’m just saying I haven’t encountered anything but the opposite advice.

Again, the takeaway is this: strive for comfort, just a *better kind* of comfort, and slowly. Unless you’re an adrenaline junkie, in which case, why are you reading this, when you could be BASE jumping?! Woooooooo!!!

Godspeed.
